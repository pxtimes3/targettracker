1. Everything starts with the caliber. Add one if it's missing. ~~You can validate any changes with `npm validate-calibers`.~~ Note the caliberId.
2. Add a bullet that has the correct caliberId. Note the bulletId.
3. Then add a cartridge (or multiple) with the correct bulletId.
4. ~~Run `npm run build`~~
5. Create a PR.
6. Once it is approved your new caliber/bulllet/cartidge now appears when you select a predefined manufacturer ammunition or create a new ammunuition entry.
